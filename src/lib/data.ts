<p>The world of interior design is ever-evolving. This year, we're seeing a strong emphasis on creating spaces that are not only beautiful but also functional and sustainable. Here are the top 5 trends to watch:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Biophilic Design:</strong> Bringing the outdoors in with natural materials, plants, and ample natural light.</li>
  <li><strong>Bold Patterns & Colors:</strong> Moving away from minimalism, expressive patterns and rich colors are making a comeback.</li>
  <li><strong>Sustainable Materials:</strong> A growing focus on using reclaimed wood, recycled materials, and eco-friendly textiles.</li>
  <li><strong>Curved Furniture:</strong> Soft lines and curved silhouettes are replacing sharp, geometric shapes for a more inviting feel.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Homes:</strong> Integration of technology for convenience and efficiency, from lighting control to automated blinds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Incorporating these trends can refresh your space and make it feel brand new. Contact us for a consultation to see how we can help!</p>
